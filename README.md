# ascii-fluid

**`ascii-fluid`** is a webcam (face) controlled terminal based ASCII fluid simulation running in your terminal. You can control the fluid dynamics with your computer mouse/touchpad but also with your face.

## How it's working?

The fluid solver implementation is mainly based on Jos Stam's paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf). The fluid dynamics are rendered in terminal with the help of [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) terminal package.

## Usage

```bash
 $ go get -u -v github.com/esimov/ascii-fluid
 $ cd wasm & make
```

This will start three new operation simultaneously: it will open a new terminal window, starts a new web server for listening the websocket connection and will build a webassembly interface for accessing the webcam. The [Pigo](https://github.com/esimov/pigo) face detection library is used to detect the webcam face and transfer the face coordinates through the socket to the main terminal app. On each refresh rate (defined as a parameter) the terminal will update the fluid particles.
